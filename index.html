                                                    dead-end the cab, installed aftermarket speakers and head-unit. Then

                                                <p>I’ve always liked the older square body gm trucks. My first truck was
                                                    a 98 Sierra, but it got demolished on snowy roads. The headache rack
                                                    was the only thing I was able to salvage and put on my new truck.

                                                <p>I work at an auto repair shop in Jonestown PA. After my fist truck
                                                    was totaled, I couldn't afford a newer truck from a dealer so I
                                                    bought an older one off Copart and rebuilt it. Since I did most of
                                                    the work myself I was able to get a truck out of the south with no
                                                    rust, restored with my own custom paint color, for a lot less money.
                                                    Also I enjoy working with my hands.</p>

                                                    the first bike I rebuilt was a 2006 Honda CBR1000RR and this is a

                                                    that I could do it again being that it was the same bike as the

                                                <p>I am a US Army Veteran. What got me into rebuilding motorcycles was
                                                    initially an accident. I got into an accident, fixed the bike and
                                                    sold it! So I thought to myself I can do this again. This second
                                                    time I saw a business opportunity I’ve envisioned in my head! I
                                                    bought this bike to rebuild and resell! I like it so much I’ve
                                                    thought about keeping it, but It’s probably going to get sold! I
                                                    knew I could do it so I did it!!</p>
